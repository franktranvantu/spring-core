# MVC 
The Spring Web MVC framework provides Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture and ready components that can be used to develop flexible and loosely coupled web applications. The MVC pattern results in separating the different aspects of the application (input logic, business logic, and UI logic), while providing a loose coupling between these elements.

- The Model encapsulates the application data and in general they will consist of POJO.
- The View is responsible for rendering the model data and in general it generates HTML output that the client's browser can interpret.
- The Controller is responsible for processing user requests and building an appropriate model and passes it to the view for rendering.
